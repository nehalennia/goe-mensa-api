# Göttingen Mensa API

This project aims to document and open up the API for the canteens at the University of Göttingen, Germany.

- [ ] Document the official API* to get meal information for all canteens in Göttingen.
- [ ] Create a Node.js wrapper around the API that returns proper JSON data.
- [ ] Make it available as a npm package.

This is a supplementary project to my upcoming Göttingen Mensa Telegram bot.

\* Unfortunately, there is no officially advertised API, but if you know where to look, you can find an API that returns a preformatted HTML table that can be parsed systematically.
